# Notes on the Jetbrains IDE'S

## PyCharm
### Add a folder of existing packages (In my case I needed my Conda packages and did not want to reinstall them)
* In PyCharm version 2020.3.1 use the following workflow instead [see official docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-project-structure.html):
* Ctrl+Alt+S - open Settings.
* File|Settings|Project|Project Structure...
* You will see project folder structure. Mark subfolders as Sources or Excluded
